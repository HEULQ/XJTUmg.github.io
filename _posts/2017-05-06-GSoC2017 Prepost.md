### GSoC work time is coming 

Fortunately, I have been selected to work for pgRouting in this GSoC period. :)    
<a target="_blank" href="https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/projects/#6305293643284480"> Link</a> to my project.  
Lots of work (see below) need to do, but there is still 6 exams waiting for me. Hope everything will be fine.  


### Wiki page

<a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/pgRouting/pgrouting/wiki/GSoC-2017-Connected-Components"> Link</a> to my wiki page.  
**A wiki page contains**  

- A brief introduction about your project
- Plan for the week
- A detailed list of tasks you need to accomplish during the week
- Links to your weekly reports

**Table of contents**  

**Links, don't open a page, must be in the same page**.

- Have a look at 
    - https://github.com/pgRouting/pgrouting/wiki/GSoC-2016-Contraction#table-of-contents
    - https://github.com/pgRouting/pgrouting/wiki/GSoC-2016-Flow#table-of-contents

**Weekly reports**  

**Send a report to the mailing list and copy it to wiki page weekly**.
**Do mention about my meetings with the mentors in the weekly reports**.

- Have a section which has the links to all the weekly report. For example, 
    - https://github.com/pgRouting/pgrouting/wiki/GSoC-2016-Contraction#status-reports
    - https://github.com/pgRouting/pgrouting/wiki/GSoC-2016-Flow#table-of-contents
