title: Final GSoC Proposal Submitted

tag: pgRouting

### Abstract
I have submitted a proposal to pgRouting, and its quality determines whether I can participate in Google Summer of Code (GSoC) this year.  
There are three parts of connected components algorithms in the Boost Graph Library (BGL),  
1. Connected components algorithm.  
2. Strongly connected components algorithm.  
3. Biconnected components algorithm.  

I am proposing to add those BGL functionalities to pgRouting during this GSoC period.
