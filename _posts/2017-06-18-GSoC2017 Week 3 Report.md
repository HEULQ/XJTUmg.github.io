I have done the code for my second function this week. But AppVoyer was failed, which means there are something wrong with my functions...

### What did you get done this week?

I got a better understanding on how to generate documentation and how to write documentation.  
I finished coding pgr_strongComponentsV function.  
And I created the documentation tests of this function.  
Details can be found in [here](https://github.com/pgRouting/pgrouting/wiki/GSoC-2017-Connected-Components#week-3).  
Set of pull requests can be found in [here](https://github.com/pgRouting/pgrouting/pulls?q=is%3Apr+author%3AXJTUmg+is%3Aclosed).

### What do you plan on doing next week?

I plan to write documentation of those two functions. Also, I plan to start a new implementation.  

### Are you blocked on anything?

No, at the moment Iâ€™m not blocked.
