The biggest news for this week is that I've had my three final exams of this semster finished.  
But... Still three final exams are pending :(  
Well, not many works I've done due to dealing with those finals. However, I don't have any exam next week, I'll have more time to work on.

### What did you get done this week?

I discussed the signature of my new function (pgr_connectedComponentsV) with mentors. And I used a script to generate my initial template code. I modified and fixed this function code to suit the signature. Created a new structure (pgr_componentV_t) instead of General_path_element_t.
Details can be found in [here](https://github.com/pgRouting/pgrouting/wiki/GSoC-2017-Connected-Components#week-1).
Set of pull requests can be found in [here](https://github.com/pgRouting/pgrouting/pulls?q=is%3Apr+author%3AXJTUmg+is%3Aclosed).

### What do you plan on doing next week?
I plan to keep working on the template code. Also I plan to learn unit tests in pgRouting and try to write some for my function.

### Are you blocked on anything?
No, at the moment Iâ€™m not blocked.
