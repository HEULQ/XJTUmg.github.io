I have done the code for my first function this week.
I will start to review (to be honest, prepare) three lessons next week.
Hope everything goes well.

### What did you get done this week?

I created a header file (pgr_components.hpp) for components algorithms.  
I finished coding pgr_connectedComponentsV function.  
And I fixed the documentation tests of this function.  
Details can be found in [here](https://github.com/pgRouting/pgrouting/wiki/GSoC-2017-Connected-Components#week-2).  
Set of pull requests can be found in [here](https://github.com/pgRouting/pgrouting/pulls?q=is%3Apr+author%3AXJTUmg+is%3Aclosed).

### What do you plan on doing next week?

I plan to implement the others function (still V version).  
Also I plan to learn how to create documentation, and try to create documentation for pgr_connectedComponentsV function.  

### Are you blocked on anything?

No, at the moment Iâ€™m not blocked.
