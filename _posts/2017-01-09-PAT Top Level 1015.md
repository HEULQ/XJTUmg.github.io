### Problem

<a target="_blank" href="https://www.patest.cn/contests/pat-t-practise/1015"> Problem</a>  

### Solution

Another way of thinking of this problem is that we can change $T$ into $S$.  
It is similar to $LCS(Longest\ Common\ Subsequence)$ problem.  
Let $C$ is the longest substring(not subsequence) in $T$ which is also a subsequence in $S$.  
The result is $n - length\ of\ C$.  
How to find $C$?  
We enumerate the leftmost index of $C$(variable $i$) in $O(n)$.  
For each $i$, we calculate the maximum rightmost index of $C$ in $O(n)$ by greedy algorithm.  
Time Complexity: $O(N^{2})$  
For details, please refer to my code.  

### Proof

Let $leftC/rightC$ is the leftmost/rightmost index of this substring in $T$.  
At each step, we can move one letter in $S$ to the beginning. We can find a way that $S[0 .. leftC - 2]$ is equal to $T[0 .. leftC - 2]$ after $leftC - 2$ steps.  
After that we move $n - rightC$ letters in $S$ to the end of it one by one correctly. $S[rightC .. n - 1]$ is equal to $T[rightC .. n - 1]$ now.  
Now $S$ is same as $T$. Why? Because of the definition of $C$.

#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

const int maxn = 1005;

int n;
char S[maxn], T[maxn];

int Calcu(int st)
{
	int p = 0;
	for (int i = st; i < n; i++, p++) {
		while (p < n && S[p] != T[i])
			p++;
		if (p == n)
			return i - st;
	}
	return n - st;
}

int main()

	scanf("%s", S);
	getchar();
	scanf("%s", T);
	n = strlen(S);
	int res = 0;
	for (int i = 0; i < n; i++)
		res = max(res, Calcu(i));
	printf("%d\n", n - res);
